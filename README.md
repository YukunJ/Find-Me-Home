# Find-Me-Home
This is a small Python toy web crawler to help me find available apartment-lease listings in Jersey City.

### Story Background

In early March, I went to Jersey City to in-person visit a few potential apartments I want to lease after graduation.

Leasing agents told me, given the 60-day move-out notice policy, lease for June will mostly be available and listed on website by end of March. Given the anticipated hot market by that time, I was advised to check the website for new listing on a regular basis.

I thought to myself: Oh, I could probably write a program to crawl for new lease listing and notify me via email.

Here we go!
